what is the shell script??

if error occur, kernel print error massege,
 so first check it where msg is printed and why
 second add debugging code and check kernel log 


if you want to know about "how function-F is work", 
then you change the kernel code for debug.

though git commit ,and git log, diff >> check what's different

after change code, build, install, reboot,
through ftrace(shell script) > trace the function-F set
execute code > ftrace log check

through ftrace log, you can know about.
How function-F is called and which process called F (call stack)
which interrupt is executed by F (handler name as well)

you will know about >>>>> how F is called, name of process call F, data structure
through <ftrace log>
